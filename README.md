This repository containts the proceedings from our seminar series on MATLAB and Simulink for Digital Agriculture, as part of a collaboration with Kansas State University's Institute for Digital Agriculture and Advanced Analytics (ID3A).

## The first session delivered in March of 2025 focused on AI-Driven Agriculture: A Low-Code Approach

## Highlights
- Explore MATLAB & Simulink: Learn how these platforms support complex agricultural research through computational modeling and simulation.
- IoT: Live demonstration on collecting, aggregating, and analyzing sensor data using ThingSpeak.
- Image Processing & AI: Live demonstration of how low-code tools in MATLAB facilitate image processing and machine learning workflows while auto-generating code. 

## The second session deliver in September of 2025 focused on MATLAB and Simulink tools for modeling and simulating agricultural systems

## Highlights

- Leveraging Simulation to Develop High-Tech Products
- Shaping a Path to Offroad Autonomy Using MATLAB
- Design and Development of a Skid-Steer Robotic Platform for Autonomous Agricultural Applications.
